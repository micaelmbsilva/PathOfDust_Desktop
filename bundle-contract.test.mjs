// Cross-repo golden contract test for the replay bundle.
//
//   node bundle-contract.test.mjs      (or: npm test)
//
// UPSTREAM FILE. This test, replay-bundle-validator.mjs, and both fixtures
// are generated/owned in the Path of Dust game repo and delivered here by
// PR. Don't hand-edit them: changes made here are overwritten by the next
// delivery. Report anything wrong with them and they get fixed at source.
//
// Why it exists: a shared schema file enforces nothing on its own, because
// server.mjs and an old desktop keep running against a stale copy of it
// regardless. Only a test that fails a build does. The server runs this
// same suite against these same fixtures, so writer and reader are checked
// from both sides of the boundary against one artifact rather than against
// two prose descriptions that agree until they quietly don't.
//
// It covers three separate things, and the middle one is the one people
// forget:
//
//   1. The golden bundle validates. (Writer and schema agree.)
//   2. FORWARD COMPATIBILITY: unknown members, unknown event kinds, unknown
//      fields and unknown enum values must all be accepted. Four surfaces
//      version independently here, so a newer writer meets an older reader
//      as a matter of routine, not as an edge case.
//   3. Genuine disagreement is still rejected: a missing required member, a
//      missing required field, a wrong type, a non-increasing seq.
//
// No dependencies: node:test, node:assert, node:fs only.
